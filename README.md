# Microsoft Power BI visuals

The Microsoft Power BI visuals project provides high quality data visualizations that you can use to extend [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).  The project contains over 20 visualization types, the framework to run them, and the testing infrastructure that enables you to build high quality visualizations.  The framework provides all the interfaces you need to integrate fully with Power BI's selection, filtering, and other UI experiences.  The code is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) so it's easier to build and debug. Everything compiles down to JavaScript and runs in modern web browsers.  The visuals are built using [D3](http://d3js.org/) but you can use your favorite technology like [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), [Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), or [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). This gives you everything you need to build custom visualizations for Power BI.

## What is included

1. `build` folder representing pre-built version of Power BI visuals library so that you can start using them right away.
2. `src` folder includes project source code for your experiments and if you will desire to create a new visual.
3. `src\Clients\PowerBIVisualsPlayground` is a sample application which could be used to try the existing visualization types or as an example how to run visuals you create.

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

There are many ways in which you can contribute.  
 
We plan to accept community code contributions including new chart types, bug fixes, and additional features for existing chart types.  We're still working out the contribution guidelines. Hold tight, we'll update you here when we've formalized the guidelines.   
 
In the meantime, you can contribute to Power BI Visuals in a few different ways:
* Submit bugs by opening an Issue.

## How To Build and Run

### Prerequisites

To build the library and run sample application you will need:

- A Windows 8.1 64-bit machine with minimum 4 GB of RAM
- [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx) (Free for use)
- [TypeScript 1.4 for Visual Studio 2013](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2d42d8dc-e085-45eb-a30b-3f7d50d55304)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download/)

In order to run unit tests you will also need:
- [Chutzpah JavaScript test runner](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah):
 - Command Line Runner [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Chutzpah) 
 - [chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages/chutzpah)
- [jasmine-jquery](https://raw.github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery/master/lib/jasmine-jquery.js) that should be placed to "PowerBI-Visuals\src\Clients\Externals\ThirdPartyIP\JasmineJQuery\"


### Build Power BI visuals

In order to build the Power BI visuals, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals.git
```

Change to the PowerBI-visuals directory:

```
cd PowerBI-visuals
```

Install dev dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Use the following commands to build and test:
```
npm run build                               # Build PowerBI Visuals into `built` folder
npm test                                    # Run unit tests (requires 'chutzpah', see Prerequisites)
```
